		<p id="competitor">Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.amywinehouse.com/">Official Amy Winehouse Page</a>. The website is a bit hard to read. It is displayed like some scrolling blogs I have seen on <em>Tumblr</em>. The posts come one after the other, but it is difficult to see where one post ends and another begins. It would be helpful on the eyes maybe to see lines between separate posts. The site has a cool title, and it is linked to social media which is useful.</p>
